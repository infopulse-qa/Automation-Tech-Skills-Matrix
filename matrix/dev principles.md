# Development Principles
Design Patterns, Software development principles, e.g. SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.
## Trainee
- Has theoretical knowledge what is OOP paradigm, able to name at least 1 development principle ( SOLID, DRY, KISS etc.)
- Knows what is a pattern, pattern types, benefits of using them
- Knows DEV language basics: knows basic types
- Has basic knowledge of data types for a given Program Language (PL) (primitive types)
## Junior
- Has practical experience and can provide examples for development principles (DRY/DIE, KISS, YAGNI)
- Knows at least 1 design pattern and able to describe it.
- Knows basic types, the difference between value and reference types.
- Can read, understand and analyse existing code, automated test.
- Can develop a simple automated test. 
- Knows 3+ different assertions and able to use them.
- Knows about complex data types and what's the difference between them for a given PL.
- Able to perform data sorting and grouping.
## Middle
- Can apply design patterns to the provided case. 
- Able to describe OOP principles applicable for a given PL (If applicable for the project).
- Can name and briefly describe each component of SOLID.
- Understands different types of frameworks (Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, Behavior-driven, Object-based).
- Can describe test automation project structure and explain the purpose of each layer. Understands how to set up the project from scratch.
- Can read, understand and refactor an existing automated test. 
- Able to describe 4+ complex data structures for a given language, and is able to compare complex data structures in terms of efficiency for a given task (for ex.Map vs HashMap, or ArrayList vs LinkedList).
- Can perform data operations like sorting, filtering, mapping, serialization/deserialization.
## Senior
- Can demonstrate or invent an example of a situation from experience when 1 or more of SOLID principles were used.
- Able to calculate automation ROI.
- Has practical experience of building test automation project from scratch.
- Can analyze of existing Test Framework and identify bottlenecks.
- Experienced in coding practices, uses efficient language features, language standards, patterns.
- Has experience on 2+ projects in developing and maintaining test frameworks, knows aspects of a given toolkit like libraries, modules, passing and accepting variables to/from CI system.
## Expert
- Uses advanced development strategies and principles.
- Understands the tradeoffs of various architecture solutions. Can identify risks of the architecture of existing test automation project and provide a plan to mitigate them.
- Able to explain/sell the benefits of selected architecture to stakeholders.
- Takes responsibility for code stability, performance and build/test execution time, improves metrics using recent PL features and IDE functionality.
